I developed a web application for inventory management using the power of natural language. This application is an example of how companies can efficiently and simply manage their product inventory.

The application allows users to interact naturally with the database, formulating queries and commands using everyday language. Through the integration of advanced natural language processing and data management technologies, the application is capable of understanding users' intentions and automatically generating customized SQL queries.

One of the most prominent features is the ability to classify user requests into three key categories: Changes, Consumption, and Data. Each category triggers specific responses and actions in the database, enabling users to make modifications, obtain historical consumption information, and access detailed data intuitively.

My focus in this project is to provide a small example of how natural language can be used to solve problems, optimize business processes, and process information for decision-making.

The project is still ongoing, and I intend to continue using this technology for other challenges within the company, such as process management, imports, sales processes, among others.
